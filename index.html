                reasoning: "The text mentions that 'some enzymes like papain from green papaya act both in acidic and alkaline media.' This biphasic activity profile suggests the enzyme's active site can function effectively under two distinct pH conditions, unlike most enzymes which have a single optimum pH."

                reasoning: "Prokaryotic cells have 70S ribosomes and often circular DNA.

                reasoning: "While not explicitly detailed in the text, prokaryotes lack a mitotic spindle and histones. A key concept is that the bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane. As the cell grows and the membrane invaginates (a process hinted at with the mesosome in some models), the chromosomes are pulled apart, enabling their segregation during binary fission."

                reasoning: "The text states nuclear pores regulate 'nucleo-cytoplasmic exchange,' which includes 'RNA... moving from nucleus to the cytoplasm.' mRNA is synthesized in the nucleus but functions in the cytoplasm on ribosomes. Blocking pores would trap mRNA in the nucleus, halting protein synthesis."

                correct: 1,
                reasoning: "The text explains that the induced fit allows the enzyme to 'mold[] the substrate into a precise shape,' and gives an example: 'if a substrate is to be split, a bond might be stretched by the enzyme, making it more likely to break.' This mechanical stress lowers the activation energy."

                reasoning: "The text states that heavy metals denature enzymes by 'breaking the disulphide bridges' and emphasizes that 'these bridges are important in maintaining tertiary structure.' A drug targeting these bonds would directly disrupt the 3D structure of enzymes reliant on them."

                reasoning: "Equilibrium is determined by the difference in free energy (ΔG) between products and reactants. By lowering the activation energy barrier, an enzyme speeds up the rate at which equilibrium is reached but does not alter the final equilibrium concentrations. This means it must catalyze the reverse reaction at the same increased rate once the product concentration is high enough."

It is only activated (to pepsin) when it reaches the safety of the stomach lumen with its low pH."
